# Playlist Recommender — Project Context

## What this is
A hybrid music recommendation system built as a portfolio project for entry-level ML/engineering recruiting. Two modes share a single user preference vector:
- **Playlist generation**: questionnaire or NLP prompt → clustered playlists
- **Song recommendation**: Spotify listening history → ranked song list

## Agreed tech stack
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI + uvicorn | async-first, native OpenAPI docs |
| DB | PostgreSQL + pgvector | relational schema + ANN search in one system |
| Migrations | Alembic | keeps schema in sync with SQLAlchemy models |
| Embeddings | sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | pre-trained, 384-dim, no training required |
| Ranker | LightGBM (impressive) / weighted cosine (MVP) | tree model on feedback features |
| Task queue | Celery + Redis | async preference vector updates after feedback |
| LLM | Claude API | NLP intent extraction from free-text prompts |
| Frontend | React + Vite + Tailwind | fast to build, easy to deploy |
| Hosting | Fly.io / Railway (backend), Supabase (DB), Vercel (frontend) | low ops overhead |

## Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose** runs local Postgres (pgvector/pgvector:pg16) + Redis for development
- **Supabase** is production Postgres — `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points there
- `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` points to Docker Postgres; `config.py` picks the right one based on `ENVIRONMENT`
- **WSL gotcha**: system PostgreSQL 14 was pre-installed and claimed port 5432. Disabled via `sudo systemctl disable postgresql@14-main`. Docker now owns 5432.
- Docker Compose project name is `playlist-recommender` (set explicitly to avoid collisions)

## Environment
- `.env` lives in `backend/` (uvicorn runs from there)
- `ENVIRONMENT=development` → uses `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`
- `ENVIRONMENT=production` → uses `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase)

## Current file state
```

    core/
      config.py       ✓ done — pydantic-settings, active_database_url property
      database.py     ✓ done — async SQLAlchemy engine, Base, get_db dependency
    main.py           ✓ done — FastAPI app, CORS, /health endpoint with DB check
  requirements.txt    ✓ done
docker-compose.yml    ✓ done
.env / .env.example   ✓ done
```

## Phase checklist
### Phase 0 — Setup ✓
- [x] Repo, .gitignore, .env
- [x] Spotify developer app registered
- [x] Supabase project created, pgvector enabled
- [x] docker-compose.yml (postgres + redis)
- [x] FastAPI scaffold (config, database, main, health check)
- [ ] React scaffold (Vite + Tailwind) ← **next**

### Phase 1 — Data Foundation (Days 2–5)
- [ ] SQLAlchemy models: Track, User, Playlist, FeedbackEvent, IntentSession
- [ ] Alembic setup + initial migration
- [ ] spotify_client.py service
- [ ] scripts/ingest_catalog.py (10–20k tracks)
- [ ] pgvector column on tracks table

### Phase 2 — MVP Pipeline (Days 6–10)
- [ ] intent_extractor.py (questionnaire → structured dict)
- [ ] retrieval.py (cosine on audio features)
- [ ] ranker.py (weighted scoring)
- [ ] playlist_builder.py (single playlist, energy arc)
- [ ] Routes: POST /intent/questionnaire, POST /playlists/generate

### Phase 3 — Frontend MVP (Days 11–14)
- [ ] Questionnaire component
- [ ] PlaylistView + TrackRow
- [ ] FeedbackButtons
- [ ] Deploy backend to Fly.io, frontend to Vercel

### Phase 4–8 — see original design doc in conversation history

## User preferences
- Explain design decisions before writing code, not after
- No comments in code files — explain in chat instead
- Walk through pieces one at a time; user wants to understand each step
- Short concise responses preferred
